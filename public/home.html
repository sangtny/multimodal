                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>If you were to walk through certain parts of Harris County in Houston, Texas, you would start to notice various Asian establishments including hair salons, restaurants, dental care, and shopping centers. But the question is, how did such a large community come to be? What are the stories or events leading up to what you will see there? We all know that the Vietnam War was the main reason for bringing in the Vietnamese within the demographics of the United States, however, what exactly drove the Vietnamese immigrants to Houston? Let’s start with the beginning.</p>

            <div id="vietnam-war" class="container-body">
                <h2>Vietnam War</h2>
                <p>The beginning can be traced back to the end of the Vietnam War when North Vietnam successfully defeated South Vietnam and unified the two warring states into one nation under communist regime. Once Vietnam has finally unified as a communist state, the new government immediately enacted reforms to solidify their positions over the southern region as well as expressing their suspicion towards the southerners<sup>[1][2]</sup>. They erected reeducation camps across the nation to teach the southerners, or those the government suspected to be against the government or their revolution, that their doings before the war were all wrong and have to correct their mistakes<sup>[1]</sup>. Following that, they seized private properties and introduced a system of censorship by controlling religious institutions, schools, the media, and also private properties with the introduction of a socialist economy<sup>[1]</sup>. Some southerners chose to accept these new reforms and rules, others chose to find ways to push back against it, while the rest chose to flee the nation<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

                <h2>Fleeing Vietnam</h2>
                <p>The Vietnamese that chose to flee the nation and managed to enter the United States were the second wave of Vietnamese immigrants to enter the United States. The first wave started when North Vietnam seized Saigon, the capital city of South Vietnam, signifying the defeat of South Vietnam<sup>[1][2]</sup>. South Vietnamese government and military officials fled to the United States along with the American troops stationed in Saigon<sup>[1]</sup>. On the other hand, the second wave consisted of a long and dangerous journey to seek asylum in the United States. With the unstable economic and political situation within Vietnam, including Laos and Cambodia, many citizens chose to flee the nation either by land or across the seas<sup>[1][3]</sup>. Most Vietnamese chose to flee on boats to neighboring countries across the seas, waiting in refugee camps in hopes to seek asylum in either United States, Canada, Australia, or France<sup>[3]</sup>. However, many have died along the journey due to the poor conditions on the overcrowded boats – and sometimes because the boats were crudely constructed from wood, marauding pirates, drowning as a result of inability to swim, harsh conditions on the sea, and lack of food and water<sup>[1][3]</sup>. In an interview with my mom who was a Vietnamese refugee that fled Vietnam on a boat, she described her experience while on a boat to a refugee camp in Malaysia. She was lucky enough to board a medium-sized fishing boat, but the conditions were still terrible as the fishing boat was overcrowded with other refugees. Everyone was uncouth, scared, nervous, but determined to leave Vietnam. My mom and a few other refugees brought food with them, but the food they brought were mainly bread or grains and only enough for themselves.</p>

                <h2>Refugee Camp</h2>
                <p>The fleeing refugees that did manage to survive and arrive at the refugee camps still face more challenges, though much better than being on the seas or living under a new government that flipped their life upside down. Most nations neighboring the Indochina nations facing economic and political deterioration did not wish to harbor any refugees within their land as the refugees rapidly consumes the nation’s resources<sup>[3]</sup>. Some nations even drove away boats carrying refugees back onto the sea<sup>[3]</sup>. Fortunately, the United Nations held a conference in 1979 to address the refugee crisis with the result of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines being the official place to house refugees in refugee camps before the refugees manage to find asylum in either the United States, Australia, France, and Canada<sup>[3]</sup>. However, refugees would spend years after years waiting to seek asylum in either of the mentioned countries and sometimes separated from their families<sup>[3]</sup>. Another challenge is overcrowding with refugee camps being built to sustain low thousands of refugees only to house as much as a few 10 thousands of refugees, leading to another challenge of poor sanitation<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>

                <h2>The Refugees</h2>
                <p>The first wave of Vietnamese refugees to enter the United States started in 1975 weeks before Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, fell when the United States military evacuated from Saigon with about 125,000 refugees entering the United States<sup>[4]</sup>. A majority of the first wave refugees had connections with the United States and came from urban background, bringing along their educated minds and skills in professional occupations with them<sup>[4]</sup>. An additional 5,000 refugees entered in the United States the following two years<sup>[4]</sup>. The second wave of Vietnamese refugees to arrive started in 1978 when the United States improved their resettlement program in order to bring back American citizens and organizations still residing in Vietnam, which in turn allowed for everyone in Vietnam to apply to the program to enter the United States<sup>[4]</sup>. The worsening economy in Vietnam, hostile relationships between Vietnam and its neighbors, the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, and the war between Vietnam and China lead to a large influx of Vietnamese refugees into the United States with about 44,500 refugees in 1979<sup>[4]</sup>. As a result of the war between Vietnam and China, there were also Chinese citizens of Vietnam in the mix of refugees<sup>[4]</sup>. The second wave refugees, unlike the first wave refugees, mainly came from rural backgrounds with little education and skills<sup>[4]</sup>. By 1980, 95,200 Vietnamese arrived in the United States followed by 86,100 Vietnamese in 1981<sup>[4]</sup>.</p>

                <h2>Second Migration</h2>
                <p>By early 1980s, many Vietnamese chose to migrate down south towards warmer states and targeted metropolitan<sup>[4]</sup>. Houston, Texas is one of the targeted metropolitan area due to the city being near the coast, which is very attractive to Vietnamese who had occupations near or on the seas back in Vietnam<sup>[5]</sup>. The city also has a resettlement site designated by the United States government, bringing in more Vietnamese in the beginning which spread word of its ideal location<sup>[5]</sup>. The Vietnamese entering the large metropolitan areas created their own ethnic community, with the most famous one being Little Saigon located in Orange County, California as it houses the largest Vietnamese population in the United States<sup>[2]</sup>. Meanwhile in Houston, the Vietnamese set up commercial establishments like restaurants, nightclubs, ballrooms, and business services<sup>[5]</sup>. In an interview with my close friend who lives in the Vietnamese area of Houston, he explains that the reason there is a large concentration of Vietnamese is due to people with great similarities, whether it’s by the color of their skin, their nationality, and their culture. He also said that his parents, formerly Vietnamese immigrants that came to the United States in the year 2000, chose to settle in the Vietnamese part of Houston due to their refusal of integrating with American culture and life. They also found comfort in a place that’s very similar to Vietnam and don’t have to worry about being a stranger in that place. In an article by Tatyana Phelps, Kandice Smith, president of the Women of Diversity organization, expresses her belief that people "have the tendency to stick to their own race because it’s comfortable, it’s familiar."<sup>[6]</sup></p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>How is there a large Vietnamese population in Houston, Texas? It started with the Vietnam War and its end, bringing in thousands of Vietnamese into the United States, hoping to start a new life and to escape the decaying turmoil in their home nation. With the challenges the Vietnamese faced while integrating into American life, they formed a community with one another and created a little enclave, which later became huge, to comfortably decorate, celebrate, and live the moment of their culture while in a foreign land. Why Houston? The Vietnamese chose Houston to settle in due to the fact that it was one of the many resettlement sites for Vietnamese refugees when the United States was aiding in the Indochinese refugee crisis. Houston also has a warm climate, similar to the southern region of Vietnam, and is near the gulf coast which a majority of the Vietnamese refugees is familiar with as they were once fishermen and farmers.</p>
